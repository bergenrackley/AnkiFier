# AnkiFier

OpenAI and Azure Computer Vision assisted Vocabulary Extractor designed with Tobira textbooks in mind, but could be expanded to work with several different formats if I felt like it (namely adding support for selecting Cell Color, which was used in grouping the row data together).
Specifically designed to output the Vocabulary into a CSV format for use in Anki later.
Uses Computer Vision to identify text and its location, and Open AI to generate Kanji for the vocabulary if missing and filter out noise from text fields captured erroneously.
